                <p>I was born in Nebraska, more specifically, Columbus, before moving to Grand Island when I was about 5 years old.
                    I have two siblings, my brother; Reese and my sister; Josilyn. After I graduated High School, I attended the 
                    University of Nebraska - Lincoln majoring in Mechanical Engineering. However, after taking a required course on C++
                    and MatLab, I decided to change my major to Computer Science. In June of 2021, I moved up to Pocatello, Idaho to be closer 
                    to family (who moved there in 2020) and also continue my college career at Idaho State University.The program was great, 
                    but it focused more on the theoretical part of computer science instead of practicality. With that in my mind, I researched 
                    other computer science programs and discovered Grand Canyon Universities Software Development program and decided to go all-in!

                <p>Currently, I live here in Idaho Falls working for both family businesses. My dad owns Ice Dam Shield; a company that specializes 
                    in ice melt and prevention systems on roofs. My mom is a health and wellness coach and owns KsJ Nutrition; which focuses more 
                    on womens' health and wellness. For Ice Dam Shield, I work in sales and the IT department creating proposals, managing the website, 
                    and occasionally helping out in the field when the situation arises. For KsJ Nutrition, I help my mom with creating content, proofreading, 
                    and with using social media from a commercial standpoint. On the side, I like coding my own programs, creating pixel art, and researching 
                    ways I can get into freelance work once I get further along in my B.S. degree.

                <p>After I graduate, I want to continue working for the family businesses but with a role within graphic design and software development. On 
                    the side, I see myself freelancing in the form of programming, game art, 3D modelling, audio production, and also working on my own projects as well. While 
                    Idaho Falls is nice, I'm leaning toward a more rural area to call a permanent home. Home Owners Associations, traffic jams, loud neighbors, 
                    and just the general city life is no longer for me! I'm thinking Montana is a great prospect. Mountains, bears, elk, and moose I find fascinating 
                    and would jump on the chance to live close to that kind of area. More importantly, colder temperatures year round. I HATE hot climates!
