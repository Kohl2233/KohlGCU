                <p>Growing up, my family was active in our church back in Nebraska and I would always attend Sunday school and 
                    Wednesday night study groups. I believed my faith in Christ was strong, however, in 2018 the death of my Aunt (who I was very close too) 
                    shook that faith. Seeing my grandfather and all of us pray in the hospital, without getting the results we wanted/hoped for, filled my mind with doubt, 
                    anger, and hurt. Following her death, I turned away from Christ, became more distant from my family, and went down paths that distanced myself even further 
                    from God. Looking back, I realized it was my own lack of understanding and that God did answer our prayers and called my aunt home. That part alone took me 
                    years to come to terms with. 
                    <br><br>
                    I came back to Christ pretty recently during my time at Idaho State University, in the summer of 2022 to be exact. One of my favorite subjects is history and on a side note, 
                    it was my second choice of major when I first started college. While reading about the Roman Empire, I read how the death and resurrection of Christ was one of 
                    the most pivotal points in human history. Something about those words flipped a switch in my mind. I remembered growing up attending church, sunday school, study groups, and most 
                    importantly; the events in that hospital. I ordered my current KJV Bible from Amazon, started from page 1, and have not stopped reading since. I found that the more I read, the more the feelings 
                    of anger, hurt, bitterness, my insecurities, anxieties, and stress disappeared. After a couple months, I realized for the first time in years I was truly happy and content with my 
                    life, goals, and gained the strength to come to terms with my past. My goal is to read 5-10 pages a day, and currently I'm on 1 Kings 8:13!

                <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Special Interest Points</h2>
                <p>With history being an interest of mine, I find some of the past events referenced in the Bible to be really fun to look deeper into. For example, Noah's Ark, the flood, 
                    and some of the extinctions that took place, all in the same time frame and all with natural evidence. Another one is Moses and the parting of the Red Sea. While most of 
                    the articles online (so far) say its a land bridge, it's still fun to look for articles that support and connect the dots. For a video on the flood, check out the 
                    clip below!
