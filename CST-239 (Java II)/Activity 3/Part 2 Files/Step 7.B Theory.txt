Polymorphism describes situations where something occurs in various forms. For this actibity, we have a base shape class called ShapeBase which is the parent for any shape we create. It has one method, calculateArea(), which is shared among every subclass. While the Cirlce, Rectangle, and Triangle classes have almost the same structure, each area is calculated differently. For the Trapezoid class, the structure is different with just one "extra" variable called widthShort, and obviously the calculateArea() method will have a different equation for calculating that area.
